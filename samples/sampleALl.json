Surgeon said too big to operate and would probably need work both sides of the diaphram which was too dangerous\n\nneeded blood thinners\nchemoembolization with Adriamycin and lipiodol\nliver surgery followed by short treatment of sorafenib: stopped due to adverse reactions\nleft thoracotemy followed by chemo:Capecitabine, bevacizumab and erlotinib\nsurgery to remove bowel obstruction\nchemo resumed: Capecitabine and bevacizumab\n\nrecurrence in liver: Micro-Surgery to remove lymph nodes around the frenic vein\nChest radiation with alternating oxaliplatin and cisplatin\n5cm tumor removed from pelvic region. Analysis suggested would be susceptible to Irinotecan (primarily) and adriamycin (secondarily).\n\n Another liver tumor - treated with CyberKnife therapy\nchemo: gemcitabine, bevacizumab and irinotecan for@ 5 months stopping first Irinotecan and a month later the other two\n\n3 months later: chemoembolization with adriamycin, cisplatin and mitomycin.

"Description": "Jenny's courageous battle with Fibrolamellar involved an initial surgery that removed a grapefruit sized tumor from her liver. Unfortunately the cancer recurred about 10 months later. At first they planned to do another surgery, but eventually aborted in favour of doing chemotherapy instead. Jenny has been doing Nexavar. After some initial setbacks, she had to stop the treatment and then resume it at a lower dose, but has worked her way up to the full dose. Though she has some side effects, including fatigue and hair thinning, she is very upbeat and keeps living life to the fullest!\n\nThis is an inspiring story.",
